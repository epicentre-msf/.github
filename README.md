## About Us

Epicentre is an epidemiology, medical research, innovation and training group embedded in [Médecins sans frontières (MSF)](https://www.msf.fr/) created in 1986. Today Epicentre conducts field epidemiology activities, research projects and training sessions in support of MSF goals of **providing medical assistance in areas where people are suffering from conflict, epidemics, disasters or where access to care is inadequate or non-existent**.

Our experience and presence within MSF enables us to design and carry out projects in complex, and often unstable, situations specific to humanitarian aid to meet the healthcare needs of these populations and support MSF’s public statements. We have research centres in Paris, France (🇫🇷), Maradi, Niger (🇳🇪) and Mbarara, Uganda (🇺🇬).

## Our Projects & Ressources

You will find here a collection of our data analysis and programming projects, some public and some only accessible to the members of our organisation. Most of the projects are coded in R, sometimes using our own packages. Here is a list of resources that are freely available and developped by us:

- [{repicentre}](https://epicentre-msf.github.io/repicentre/) : an open-source repository of self-paced R tutorials applied to context of humanitarian emergencies.
- [Data Science Gallery](https://epicentre-msf.github.io/gallery/): A gallery of dashboard, tools and packages developped by the Data Science team.
- [Epishiny](https://github.com/epicentre-msf/epishiny): A R package that provides tools for interactive visualisation of epidemiological data.
- [Meeting place planner](https://apps.epicentre-msf.org/public/app/carbon-travel-app): a freely available tool to find the best locations to host MSF meetings while minimising flight travel emissions.
